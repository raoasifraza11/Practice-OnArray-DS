Practice on Arrays for Data Structures in C++

# Problem (1)
Read the entries of an array of 10 integers from a user. Compute **x** as the average of the 10 entries and
then compute the average of those entries that are grater than or equal to x. Print this final average.

# Problem (2)
Write a c++ program that setup an arry of integers with capacity 20 it should then generate the 20 entries randomly in turn.
Each entry must be an integer between 1 and 20, however it must also be different from all previous entries in the array.
Generate the entries is random numbers and repeatedly make new numbers until a legal entery value in found. The program should
finish by printing the list of 20 array values that it has selected.

# Problem (3)
Eight queens are to be placed on an 8 x 8 chessboard in such a very that one queen is to be in each row. A program will store
an arry x[] with capacity 8 to represent such a confuguration. If x[r] has value c then in row r there is a queen in column
c. Write a program that asks a user to enter the column that contain queens in the 8 rows. The program than prints the board
For example. If the user enters 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7, 6, 7 the program should print.
